    - Paid (You have to purchase windows OS to use it)
    - 80% Desktop Based ( it want its own hardware components )

    - 90% Server Based ( )
    - Light Weight ( It requires less H/W componants)
    - Monolithic ( its in single part, like if there is error the evrything will stop )
    - CLI oriented ( mostly persforms action text/command based but minumum GUI)
    
- LinuxOS
